Analysis of Unclassified MCP Server Errors
===========================================

The test scripts classify gmcpt results into: success, auth_required, connection_blocked,
connection_failed, and timeout. Anything else falls into "error" (status=error). This
document analyzes every error-status result across all three sources.

Total errors: 201
  awesome_remote (awesome-remote-mcp-servers): 29 out of 106 servers
  mcpservers_org (mcpservers.org):             14 out of  24 servers
  pulsemcp (pulsemcp.com):                    158 out of 477 servers

The errors fall into the following categories.

==============================================================================
1. SSE Missing Endpoint (103 servers)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  missing endpoint: first event is "", want "endpoint"

Sources: 23 awesome_remote, 12 mcpservers_org, 68 pulsemcp

All 103 servers use SSE transport. The server accepts the HTTP connection and
begins an SSE stream, but the first event is empty instead of the expected
"endpoint" event that tells the client where to send JSON-RPC messages. This is
the behavior of OAuth-protected SSE servers: they start an SSE stream but
withhold the endpoint until the client authenticates. Since gmcpt does not
perform OAuth, the connection stalls.

PLAN.txt already documents this as a known issue: "Many SSE servers that require
OAuth return a 'missing endpoint' error from gmcpt rather than a clear 401."

These should be reclassified as auth_required (probable OAuth).

Affected servers include major vendors: Linear, Notion, Atlassian, Sentry,
PayPal, Square, Neon, Intercom, monday.com, Cloudflare (Workers, Observability,
AutoRAG, DNS Analytics, Browser Rendering, Radar, Audit Logs, Dex Analysis, CASB,
AI Gateway, Logpush), Asana, Wix, Webflow, Globalping, DeepWiki (SSE), Plaid,
Prisma, PostHog, DevCycle, Twelve Labs, Enigma, and many others.

==============================================================================
2. SSE Malformed Stream: Auth Messages (6 servers)
==============================================================================

Error messages:
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "Missing Authorization header"
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "Bearer token is required"
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "Missing or invalid access token"
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "Missing access token"
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "Missing API_BASE_URL header"
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "Bearer auth with NWC connection
    secret or nwc query parameter not provided"

Sources: 6 pulsemcp

These servers respond to the SSE connection request with a plaintext auth error
instead of a proper HTTP 401 status code. The error is written directly into
the SSE stream as a non-SSE-formatted line, which gmcpt reports as "malformed
line in SSE stream".

These should be reclassified as auth_required. The servers are: GoMarble,
ThoughtSpot (SSE endpoint), Vapi, Trade It, Opsera, and Alby Bitcoin Payments
(SSE endpoint).

==============================================================================
3. SSE Malformed Stream: "Not Found" (7 servers)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "Not Found"

Sources: 1 awesome_remote (Semgrep), 1 mcpservers_org (Semgrep), 5 pulsemcp

The server returns a "Not Found" plaintext response instead of an SSE stream.
This means the SSE endpoint path is wrong, the server has been decommissioned,
or the path requires authentication to even resolve. In the case of Semgrep, the
/sse endpoint likely no longer exists (it may have migrated to streamable-http).

These should be reclassified as connection_failed (endpoint not found).

==============================================================================
4. SSE Malformed Stream: "404 page not found" (1 server)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "404 page not found"

Sources: 1 pulsemcp (Helm)

Same as category 3 but with a different "not found" message format. Should be
reclassified as connection_failed.

==============================================================================
5. SSE Malformed Stream: HTML Pages (9 servers)
==============================================================================

Error messages:
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "<!DOCTYPE html>"
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "<!doctype html>"
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "<html lang=\"en\">"
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "<html>"
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "        <script>"
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "                    <html>"

Sources: 9 pulsemcp

The server returns an HTML page instead of an SSE stream. This typically means
the URL points to a web page (marketing site, documentation, or login page)
rather than an active SSE endpoint. The URL may be wrong, or the server may
redirect unauthenticated SSE requests to a web page.

Affected: Poku Labs, OECD (SSE), Kolada (SSE), OneContext, Proofly, svelte-llm
(SSE), mcpx, Excel to JSON (SSE), 1MCPServer, Foqal, Stumpy.

These should be reclassified as connection_failed (wrong endpoint / not an MCP
server at this URL).

==============================================================================
6. SSE Malformed Stream: JSON Error Responses (2 servers)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  missing endpoint: malformed line in SSE stream: "[\"Error\",\"InternalError\"]"

Sources: 1 mcpservers_org (Ahrefs SSE), 1 pulsemcp (Ahrefs)

Ahrefs returns a JSON error array instead of an SSE stream. This is a
server-side error (internal error). Should be reclassified as connection_failed
(server error).

==============================================================================
7. SSE Malformed Stream: Other Messages (5 servers)
==============================================================================

Error messages:
  malformed line in SSE stream: "no available server"          (Supabase SSE)
  malformed line in SSE stream: "Internal Server Error"        (Bitte AI)
  malformed line in SSE stream: "An unexpected error..."       (jooq-mcp)
  malformed line in SSE stream: "{"                            (textarttools, ONLYOFFICE)

Sources: 5 pulsemcp

Miscellaneous plaintext or JSON responses in the SSE stream. "no available
server" and "Internal Server Error" are server-side failures. The "{" cases are
likely JSON error bodies. The "An unexpected error" case is a generic server
crash.

Supabase and Bitte AI: server-side error (reclassify as connection_failed).
textarttools and ONLYOFFICE: truncated JSON body, likely an error response
(reclassify as connection_failed).
jooq-mcp: transient server error (reclassify as connection_failed).

==============================================================================
8. SSE Wrong Event Name (1 server)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  missing endpoint: first event is "connect", want "endpoint"

Sources: 1 pulsemcp (Tableall)

The server sends an SSE event named "connect" instead of the expected "endpoint"
event. This server is using a non-standard or older version of the MCP SSE
protocol. Should be reclassified as error (protocol mismatch).

==============================================================================
9. HTTP 503 Service Unavailable (10 servers)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  calling "initialize": rejected by transport: sending "initialize": Service Unavailable

Sources: 2 awesome_remote, 8 pulsemcp

All use streamable-http transport. The server returns HTTP 503, meaning it is
temporarily down, overloaded, or in maintenance. Affected: OpenMesh, CustomGPT.ai,
Generect, OSINT, Paperclip, Gemini, OECD, Kolada, SCB, Outrun.

These should be reclassified as connection_failed (server unavailable).

==============================================================================
10. HTTP 400 Bad Request on Initialize (8 servers)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  calling "initialize": sending "initialize": Bad Request

Sources: 8 pulsemcp

The server rejects the initialize request with HTTP 400. This can mean the
server requires specific headers (e.g., an API key or auth token in a custom
header), expects a different content type, or the MCP protocol version is
incompatible.

Affected: ThoughtSpot (streamable-http), KnowSync, Alby Bitcoin Payments
(streamable-http), DAM Butler, Sophtron, DevPlan, Sideways (streamable-http),
Nomad Stays.

Likely auth_required for most of these (the server demands credentials but
returns 400 instead of 401).

==============================================================================
11. HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed (5 servers)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  calling "initialize": sending "initialize": Method Not Allowed

Sources: 5 pulsemcp

The server rejects POST requests to the MCP endpoint. This means either:
(a) the URL is wrong (it's a GET-only endpoint or webpage), or (b) the server
does not support streamable-http at this URL.

Affected: Excel to JSON, Stytch, BioContext, hmr (promplate), AI-Archive.

These should be reclassified as connection_failed (endpoint does not support
MCP streamable-http).

==============================================================================
12. Session Not Found (10 servers)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  calling "initialize": sending "initialize": failed to connect (session ID: ):
    session not found

Sources: 10 pulsemcp

The server expects a pre-existing session (possibly established through a
separate auth flow or session setup endpoint). gmcpt sends an initialize request
without a session ID and the server rejects it. This pattern is common with
servers that require authentication to establish a session first.

Affected: CoinAPI (Real-time Rates, Indexes), Contextual AI, Currency
Conversion, Finlab AI, HeyOnCall, Blooio, Kogna, Partd MCP, WordPress REST API.

These should be reclassified as auth_required (session/auth required).

==============================================================================
13. Method Not Found: prompts/list (10 servers)
==============================================================================

Error messages:
  listing prompts: calling "prompts/list": Method not found: prompts/list   (9)
  listing prompts: calling "prompts/list": Method not found                 (1)

Sources: 10 pulsemcp

These servers initialize successfully and respond to tools/list, but fail when
gmcpt calls prompts/list. The MCP spec makes prompts/list optional -- servers
that don't support prompts are not required to implement this method. gmcpt
calls it because it was invoked with -prompts, and treats the "method not found"
response as a fatal error.

Affected: 8 WordPress.org Trac instances, GoPluto AI, Outris Identity MCP.

This is a gmcpt bug / limitation: it should treat "method not found" for
prompts/list (and resources/list) as an empty list, not a fatal error. These
servers are actually working. They should be reclassified as success.

==============================================================================
14. Method Not Found: resources/list (1 server)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  listing resources: calling "resources/list": Method not found

Sources: 1 pulsemcp (UIDriver)

Same issue as category 13 but for resources/list instead of prompts/list. The
server works but doesn't implement the optional resources/list method. Should be
reclassified as success.

==============================================================================
15. Bad Request After Initialize: notifications/initialized (2 servers)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  sending "notifications/initialized": Bad Request

Sources: 1 awesome_remote (WebZum), 1 pulsemcp (gas-library-hub)

The server accepts the initialize request but rejects the subsequent
"notifications/initialized" notification with HTTP 400. This is a server-side
protocol implementation bug: the server doesn't handle the standard MCP
notifications/initialized message.

Should be reclassified as error (server protocol bug).

==============================================================================
16. Bad Request After Initialize: tools/list (1 server)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  listing tools: calling "tools/list": sending "tools/list": Bad Request

Sources: 1 pulsemcp (lilo-property)

The server initializes but rejects the tools/list call with HTTP 400. Another
server-side protocol implementation bug. Should be reclassified as error
(server protocol bug).

==============================================================================
17. HTTP 502 Bad Gateway (2 servers)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  calling "initialize": rejected by transport: sending "initialize": Bad Gateway

Sources: 2 pulsemcp (svelte-llm streamable-http, La Palma 24)

The reverse proxy or load balancer in front of the server returns 502. The
backend server is unreachable or crashing. Should be reclassified as
connection_failed.

==============================================================================
18. HTTP 402 Payment Required (1 server)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  calling "initialize": sending "initialize": Payment Required

Sources: 1 awesome_remote (Dappier)

The server requires a paid subscription. This is a form of auth: the caller
must provide valid credentials tied to a paid account. Could be reclassified
as auth_required.

==============================================================================
19. HTTP 406 Not Acceptable (2 servers)
==============================================================================

Error messages:
  calling "initialize": sending "initialize": Not Acceptable   (Context Awesome)
  calling "initialize": failed to write: 406 Not Acceptable    (Gralio)

Sources: 1 awesome_remote, 1 pulsemcp

The server rejects the request's Accept or Content-Type headers. This is likely
a protocol mismatch: the server may not support the content negotiation that
gmcpt uses for streamable-http. Could be reclassified as connection_failed
(protocol mismatch).

==============================================================================
20. HTTP 421 Misdirected Request (1 server)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  calling "initialize": sending "initialize": Misdirected Request

Sources: 1 pulsemcp (Galileo)

The server returns HTTP 421 which means the request was directed to a server
that is not able to produce a response for the given URI. Likely a TLS/SNI or
reverse proxy configuration issue. Should be reclassified as connection_failed.

==============================================================================
21. HTTP 500 Internal Server Error (1 server)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  calling "initialize": rejected by transport: sending "initialize":
    Internal Server Error

Sources: 1 pulsemcp (Hub Tools)

The server crashes during initialization. Should be reclassified as
connection_failed (server error).

==============================================================================
22. HTTP 501 Not Implemented (1 server)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  standalone SSE stream: Not Implemented

Sources: 1 pulsemcp (Build Vault)

The server responds to the streamable-http endpoint with 501 Not Implemented.
This means the server is deployed but the MCP functionality is not yet
implemented. Should be reclassified as connection_failed.

==============================================================================
23. HTTP 404 Not Found via SSE write (1 server)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  calling "initialize": failed to write: 404 Not Found

Sources: 1 pulsemcp (Sideways SSE)

After connecting to the SSE stream, the client tried to POST to the returned
endpoint but got a 404. The endpoint URL may be wrong or the server may be
misconfigured. Should be reclassified as connection_failed.

==============================================================================
24. Empty HTTP Error Body (3 servers)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  calling "initialize": sending "initialize":
  (message ends with colon and no further text)

Sources: 3 pulsemcp (Rostro, HowRisky, Meminal)

The server returns an HTTP error with an empty body. gmcpt formats this as the
HTTP method path followed by nothing. The server is responding with an error
status code but no message. Should be reclassified as connection_failed
(server returned empty error).

==============================================================================
25. Invalid JSON-RPC Version Tag (2 servers)
==============================================================================

Error messages:
  listing tools: calling "tools/list": sending "tools/list": failed to decode
    response: invalid message version tag ""; expected "2.0"
  listing prompts: connection closed: calling "prompts/list": client is closing:
    standalone SSE stream: failed to decode event: invalid message version tag
    ""; expected "2.0"

Sources: 2 pulsemcp (SEO LinkMap, Exotel)

The server initializes but sends JSON-RPC responses without the required
"jsonrpc": "2.0" field (or with an empty string). This is a server-side bug in
JSON-RPC protocol compliance. Should be reclassified as error (server protocol
bug).

==============================================================================
26. Invalid JSON Unmarshaling (1 server)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  calling "initialize": json: cannot unmarshal bool into Go struct field
    ServerCapabilities.capabilities.tools of type mcp.ToolCapabilities

Sources: 1 pulsemcp (echo3D)

The server sends a capabilities object where the "tools" field is a boolean
(e.g., true) instead of the expected object (e.g., {"listChanged": false}).
This is a server-side bug: the server's MCP implementation uses the wrong
type for the tools capability. Should be reclassified as error (server
protocol bug).

==============================================================================
27. Failed to Decode: Invalid Request (2 servers)
==============================================================================

Error messages:
  calling "initialize": sending "initialize": failed to decode response:
    invalid request                                     (Web-To-MCP)
  calling "initialize": sending "initialize": failed to decode event:
    invalid request                                     (Idealift)

Sources: 2 pulsemcp

The server responds to initialize with something that cannot be decoded as a
valid JSON-RPC response. Should be reclassified as error (server protocol bug).

==============================================================================
28. Template Variable in URL (1 server)
==============================================================================

Error message:
  Get "https://<YOUR_PINECONE_ASSISTANT_HOST>/mcp/assistants/
    %3CYOUR_ASSISTANT_NAME%3E/sse": Bad Request

Sources: 1 pulsemcp (Pinecone Assistant)

The URL contains template variables (<YOUR_PINECONE_ASSISTANT_HOST>) that were
not filtered out. The pulsemcp test script filters URLs containing "{" but this
URL uses "<>" angle bracket templates instead. Should be reclassified as error
(untestable URL -- template variables).
